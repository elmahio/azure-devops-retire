# Run Retire.js as part of a Pipeline

This extension will let you call Retire.js as part of a Azure DevOps build pipeline. Detect JavaScript libraries with vulnerabilities as part of your build. All credits go back to the developers of [Retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js).

## Usage

Go to the [Retire extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elmahio.retire-extension) on the Azure DevOps Marketplace and click the _Get it free_ button.

Select your organization and click the *Install* button.

In the pipeline, search for 'retire' in the *Tasks* view and click the *Run Retire* search result.

The task will run with default values for all options but you can tweak them if you like.
